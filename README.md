## Assignment 1

Create a Class named _SumOfInts.java_ with a runnable public main method which will determine from a prefixed array of int if the specified input parameter is the sum of two of the array elements:

Notes
- Use the input _args_ parameters of the main method.
- Print the two numbers of the array which sum is the specified in the input parameter
- Print all the occurrences of two numbers


## Assignment 2

Create a Class named _GessNumber.java_ with a runnable public main method which will be in charge of guessing an initial random number.

Notes:
- The initial random number needs to be created at the begining and within the range from 0 to 100
- The program will need to read the user input and determine if the number is the exact, lower or higher.
- In case of not matching the expected number, help the user printing if it is higher or lower.
- The program will not end until the number is found or the input text "quit" is found.
